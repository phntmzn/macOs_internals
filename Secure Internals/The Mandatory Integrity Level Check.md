In macOS, there is no direct equivalent to Windows' **Mandatory Integrity Control (MIC)** or its associated integrity levels (like **NoWriteUp**, **NoReadUp**, etc.). However, macOS implements **System Integrity Protection (SIP)** and other security mechanisms that ensure certain system resources and files are only modifiable by trusted processes. While we can't implement a direct mapping of **integrity levels** on macOS, we can simulate **Mandatory Integrity Level (MIL) checks** by leveraging system-level privileges and protections, such as SIP, **root privileges**, and process **sandboxing**.

Here’s how we can simulate a similar integrity-level mechanism in Python by:
1. **Checking system conditions** such as SIP status, root privileges, or process sandboxing.
2. **Restricting access** based on conditions that simulate the **NoWriteUp** or **NoExecuteUp** policies.

### Step 1: Simulate Mandatory Integrity Levels (MIL)

We can simulate **integrity levels** by checking the process’s trust level, system protection status, and the access requested. We'll define different **trust levels** for processes based on whether they are running as root, sandboxed, or protected by SIP.

### Integrity Level Simulation:

- **High Integrity**: Processes running as root or with SIP enabled.
- **Medium Integrity**: Normal processes not running as root, but not sandboxed.
- **Low Integrity**: Sandboxed processes or processes without SIP protection.

### Step 2: Define MIL Check in Python

We will create a function that checks the integrity level of the process and enforces policies like **NoWriteUp** and **NoExecuteUp** based on the requested access type.

```python
import os
import subprocess

# Simulated integrity levels
INTEGRITY_HIGH = 3
INTEGRITY_MEDIUM = 2
INTEGRITY_LOW = 1

class IntegrityContext:
    def __init__(self, filepath, access_type):
        self.filepath = filepath
        self.access_type = access_type
        self.integrity_level = self.get_integrity_level()

    def get_integrity_level(self):
        """
        Simulate the process of determining the integrity level of the current process.
        Returns an integer representing the integrity level.
        """
        # Check if process is running as root
        if os.geteuid() == 0:
            print("Process running as root (High Integrity).")
            return INTEGRITY_HIGH
        
        # Check if System Integrity Protection (SIP) is enabled
        try:
            result = subprocess.run(['csrutil', 'status'], capture_output=True, text=True)
            if "enabled" in result.stdout:
                print("SIP is enabled (High Integrity).")
                return INTEGRITY_HIGH
            else:
                print("SIP is not enabled (Medium Integrity).")
                return INTEGRITY_MEDIUM
        except FileNotFoundError:
            print("csrutil command not found, assuming SIP is not enabled (Medium Integrity).")
            return INTEGRITY_MEDIUM

        # Check if the process is sandboxed (Low Integrity)
        try:
            with open('/System/Library/CoreServices', 'r'):
                pass
        except PermissionError:
            print("Process is sandboxed (Low Integrity).")
            return INTEGRITY_LOW

        # Default to Medium Integrity for normal processes
        print("Process is running without special privileges (Medium Integrity).")
        return INTEGRITY_MEDIUM

def test_mandatory_integrity_level(context):
    """
    Test the mandatory integrity level check for the current process.
    Simulate NoWriteUp, NoReadUp, and NoExecuteUp policies.
    """
    # Define access policies based on integrity level
    if context.integrity_level == INTEGRITY_LOW:
        if 'write' in context.access_type:
            print("Access denied: NoWriteUp policy applied.")
            return False
        if 'execute' in context.access_type:
            print("Access denied: NoExecuteUp policy applied.")
            return False
    elif context.integrity_level == INTEGRITY_MEDIUM:
        if 'write' in context.access_type and 'high' in context.filepath:
            print("Access denied: NoWriteUp policy for high-level resource.")
            return False

    # If no policies are violated, grant access
    print(f"Access granted for {context.access_type} on {context.filepath}.")
    return True

if __name__ == "__main__":
    filepath = '/path/to/high-level/resource'  # Simulated high-level file
    access_type = ['read', 'write']  # Requested access types
    context = IntegrityContext(filepath, access_type)
    
    if test_mandatory_integrity_level(context):
        print("Access check passed.")
    else:
        print("Access check failed.")
```

### Explanation:

- **Integrity Levels**: We simulate three levels of integrity: **High**, **Medium**, and **Low**.
  - **High Integrity**: Processes running as root or under **SIP** protection.
  - **Medium Integrity**: Normal user processes that are not protected by **SIP**.
  - **Low Integrity**: Sandboxed processes or processes without **SIP** protection.
  
- **Policies**:
  - **NoWriteUp**: Restricts write access for lower integrity processes (e.g., sandboxed or normal processes writing to high-level resources).
  - **NoExecuteUp**: Restricts execute access for lower integrity processes.
  
- **Access Types**: The function checks requested access types (`read`, `write`, `execute`) and applies the appropriate restrictions based on the simulated integrity level of the process.

### Step 3: Run the Script

You can test the script by providing a file path and the desired access type. The script will simulate integrity checks and enforce the appropriate policies.

```bash
python3 integrity_check.py
```

### Example Output:

If the process is sandboxed and requests write access, the output might be:

```
Process is sandboxed (Low Integrity).
Access denied: NoWriteUp policy applied.
Access check failed.
```

If the process is running as root and requests read access, the output might be:

```
Process running as root (High Integrity).
Access granted for ['read', 'write'] on /path/to/high-level/resource.
Access check passed.
```

### Conclusion:

This Python script simulates **Mandatory Integrity Level (MIL) checks** by checking system-level protections like **root privileges**, **System Integrity Protection (SIP)**, and **sandboxing**. The script enforces access control policies such as **NoWriteUp** and **NoExecuteUp**, denying or granting access based on the process's integrity level.

This approach provides a macOS-specific way to emulate the behavior of Windows' **Mandatory Integrity Control (MIC)**. Would you like to explore further enhancements, such as handling more detailed access masks or integrating with macOS’s sandbox profiles?
