The content you've provided seems to focus on Windows internals, specifically around the I/O manager, device drivers, kernel modules, processes, and threads, which are all Windows-specific concepts, typically accessed using tools like PowerShell and NT system calls.

For macOS (which is Unix-based), the structure and system calls for interacting with devices, processes, and threads are different. You would interact with these through a combination of `bash` shell commands, native macOS utilities, and possibly the IOKit framework for device interactions.

Here's how you could achieve similar tasks on macOS using `bash` and other built-in utilities:

1. **Listing Kernel Extensions (Drivers)**:
   You can use the `kextstat` command to list kernel extensions (analogous to kernel drivers in Windows):
   ```bash
   kextstat
   ```

2. **Listing Block Devices**:
   You can list block devices (like hard drives, USB drives, etc.) using:
   ```bash
   diskutil list
   ```

3. **Accessing Process and Thread Information**:
   You can list all running processes using `ps`:
   ```bash
   ps aux
   ```

   To get detailed information about a specific process, you can use:
   ```bash
   ps -p <pid> -o pid,ppid,comm
   ```

   For thread information, you could use `top` or, for more specific details, `sudo dtruss`:
   ```bash
   sudo dtruss -p <pid>
   ```

4. **Interacting with Device Files**:
   On macOS, device files are located under `/dev`. You can list them using:
   ```bash
   ls /dev
   ```

5. **Kernel Modules**:
   To get detailed information about loaded kernel modules, use `kextstat`:
   ```bash
   kextstat | grep -i 'module_name'
   ```

6. **Opening Files in the Filesystem**:
   You can open a file (similar to `NtCreateFile` in Windows) using the `open` command:
   ```bash
   open /path/to/file
   ```

While macOS doesn't use `NtQuerySystemInformation` or related commands, you can typically get similar results using tools like `ps`, `top`, and system utilities available through `bash`.
