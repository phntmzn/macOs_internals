In macOS, the process of searching and loading dynamic libraries is somewhat similar to how it works in Windows with DLLs, but instead, macOS uses **dylibs** (dynamic libraries). The loader in macOS follows a predefined search order to locate and load dynamic libraries when you don't provide an absolute path, akin to the DLL search order in Windows.

Here’s how dynamic libraries are searched for and loaded in macOS, along with how you can manipulate and inspect them using Python.

### Dynamic Library Loading in macOS

macOS uses **dyld**, the dynamic loader, to load dynamic libraries (`.dylib` files). When a dynamic library is loaded, `dyld` searches for the library in a specific order:

1. The directory containing the executable
2. The current working directory
3. Directories specified in the `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable
4. Directories specified in the `DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable
5. The standard system library directories (`/usr/lib`, `/usr/local/lib`, etc.)

In macOS, shared libraries can also be preloaded in a way similar to Windows' KnownDLLs using the `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` environment variable, which forces the loader to insert specific libraries into the process space.

### Using Python to Load and Inspect Dynamic Libraries

You can use Python’s `ctypes` or `subprocess` module to load and inspect dynamic libraries, just as you would interact with DLLs in Windows.

#### Loading a Dynamic Library in Python

Using `ctypes.CDLL`, you can dynamically load and call functions from a `.dylib`:

```python
import ctypes

# Load a dynamic library (libc in this case)
libc = ctypes.CDLL("/usr/lib/libc.dylib")

# Call a function from the library
printf = libc.printf
printf(b"Hello, macOS!\n")
```

#### Listing Imported Symbols (Similar to Get-Win32ModuleImport)

macOS doesn’t have a direct equivalent to the Windows `Get-Win32ModuleImport` command, but you can use `otool` to inspect the dynamic libraries and imported functions.

You can invoke `otool` using Python’s `subprocess` module:

```python
import subprocess

# Path to the binary or library you want to inspect
binary_path = "/path/to/your/executable_or_library.dylib"

# Use 'otool -L' to list linked dynamic libraries
linked_libraries = subprocess.run(['otool', '-L', binary_path], capture_output=True, text=True)
print("Linked Libraries:\n", linked_libraries.stdout)

# Use 'otool -TV' to list imported symbols (functions)
imported_symbols = subprocess.run(['otool', '-TV', binary_path], capture_output=True, text=True)
print("Imported Symbols:\n", imported_symbols.stdout)
```

- `otool -L`: Lists the linked dynamic libraries, similar to how `Get-Win32ModuleImport` shows imported DLLs.
- `otool -TV`: Lists the imported functions (symbols) in a dynamic library or executable.

#### Finding Symbols and Functions in Dynamic Libraries

If you want to find the memory address of a specific function (similar to `GetProcAddress` in Windows), you can use the `ctypes` module to access a function by name:

```python
import ctypes

# Load the dynamic library
libc = ctypes.CDLL("/usr/lib/libc.dylib")

# Access a function (e.g., printf) by name
printf = libc.printf
printf.argtypes = [ctypes.c_char_p]
printf.restype = ctypes.c_int

# Call the function
printf(b"Hello, World from macOS!\n")
```

#### Handling DYLD Path Environment Variables

If you need to modify the search paths for dynamic libraries, you can set or inspect `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` in Python:

```python
import os

# Set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH to include additional directories
os.environ["DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH"] = "/path/to/your/libraries:" + os.environ.get("DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH", "")

# Now, when loading a library, the loader will search in the specified directory first
```

This approach is similar to how `PATH` is handled for executables and `LoadLibrary` behavior in Windows.

### Conclusion

While macOS uses different terminology and mechanisms for loading dynamic libraries compared to Windows, the concepts are quite similar. Python’s `ctypes` and `subprocess` modules, along with system tools like `otool`, allow you to load, inspect, and manipulate dynamic libraries (`.dylib` files) on macOS in a manner analogous to handling DLLs in Windows. You can dynamically load libraries, check imported symbols, and set up library search paths using environment variables.
