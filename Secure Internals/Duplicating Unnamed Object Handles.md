In Windows, duplicating unnamed object handles refers to the ability to duplicate a handle to a kernel object (such as a mutex, file, or event) without necessarily having a name associated with it. This is commonly used in inter-process communication (IPC), allowing multiple processes to share access to a resource without knowing the resource's name.

On macOS, the direct equivalent of unnamed kernel object handles doesn't exist in the same way as it does in Windows, particularly for kernel objects like mutexes or events. However, there are similar concepts involving **file descriptors**, **shared memory**, and **POSIX IPC mechanisms** that allow resource sharing between processes.

### Duplicating File Descriptors (Similar to Duplicating Handles in Windows)

On macOS, you can duplicate a file descriptor, which is somewhat analogous to duplicating handles in Windows. File descriptors can be shared between processes, allowing access to the same resource (like a file or a socket). Python provides access to these low-level file operations via the `os` module.

Here’s an example of duplicating file descriptors in Python on macOS:

### Example: Duplicating File Descriptors in Python

```python
import os

def duplicate_file_descriptor(filepath):
    # Open a file and get its file descriptor
    original_fd = os.open(filepath, os.O_RDWR | os.O_CREAT)
    print(f"Original file descriptor: {original_fd}")

    # Write some data to the file
    os.write(original_fd, b"Hello from the original file descriptor!\n")

    # Duplicate the file descriptor
    duplicated_fd = os.dup(original_fd)
    print(f"Duplicated file descriptor: {duplicated_fd}")

    # Write more data using the duplicated file descriptor
    os.write(duplicated_fd, b"Hello from the duplicated file descriptor!\n")

    # Close both file descriptors
    os.close(original_fd)
    os.close(duplicated_fd)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    filepath = '/path/to/your/duplicated_file.txt'
    duplicate_file_descriptor(filepath)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Opening the File:** The `os.open()` function opens the file and returns a file descriptor (`original_fd`), which is an integer that represents the open file.
2. **Duplicating the File Descriptor:** The `os.dup()` function duplicates the file descriptor. Both the original and duplicated descriptors refer to the same underlying file, allowing both to read/write to the file.
3. **Writing to the File:** The script writes to the file using both the original and duplicated file descriptors to demonstrate that they reference the same resource.
4. **Closing the Descriptors:** Both file descriptors are closed with `os.close()`.

### Duplicating File Descriptors Across Processes

To simulate sharing file descriptors between processes (similar to duplicating unnamed handles across processes in Windows), you can use **file descriptor inheritance** or pass file descriptors using sockets or shared memory.

Here’s a more advanced example showing how to use file descriptor inheritance with `fork()`:

### Example: Sharing File Descriptors Between Parent and Child Processes

```python
import os

def child_process(duplicated_fd):
    # Write to the file using the inherited file descriptor
    os.write(duplicated_fd, b"Hello from the child process!\n")
    os.close(duplicated_fd)

def parent_process(filepath):
    # Open a file and get its file descriptor
    original_fd = os.open(filepath, os.O_RDWR | os.O_CREAT)
    print(f"Parent process file descriptor: {original_fd}")

    # Duplicate the file descriptor
    duplicated_fd = os.dup(original_fd)
    print(f"Duplicated file descriptor (in parent): {duplicated_fd}")

    # Fork the process
    pid = os.fork()

    if pid == 0:
        # Child process
        child_process(duplicated_fd)
    else:
        # Parent process continues
        os.write(original_fd, b"Hello from the parent process!\n")
        os.close(original_fd)
        os.wait()  # Wait for the child to finish

if __name__ == '__main__':
    filepath = '/path/to/your/inherited_file.txt'
    parent_process(filepath)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Forking the Process:** The `os.fork()` call creates a new process (a child) that inherits the file descriptor from the parent.
2. **Writing in Both Processes:** Both the parent and child processes write to the same file via the inherited file descriptor.
3. **Inter-Process Sharing:** This mimics the idea of duplicating unnamed handles between processes in Windows, allowing multiple processes to access the same resource without needing to reference it by name.

### Key Differences from Windows:
- **File Descriptors vs. Handles:** On macOS (and Unix-like systems), file descriptors are used to reference resources, while Windows uses handles.
- **Shared Access:** File descriptors can be shared between processes through inheritance or explicit passing (e.g., via a Unix socket), similar to how unnamed handles can be duplicated across processes in Windows.
- **POSIX IPC:** For inter-process communication, POSIX mechanisms like shared memory, pipes, and message queues are commonly used on macOS.
