In macOS, while the process for viewing imported APIs (as described for Windows with tools like `Get-Win32ModuleImport`) doesn't apply directly, you can achieve something similar using Python and standard Unix-based tools.

Here’s how you can list imported symbols from dynamic libraries on macOS using Python:

### Option 1: Using `subprocess` to call `otool`
macOS provides the `otool` command-line tool, which can be used to display information about the libraries and symbols used by executables. This is somewhat similar to the Windows `Get-Win32ModuleImport` behavior.

You can use Python's `subprocess` module to run `otool` and retrieve the list of imported symbols.

1. **Install `otool`**:
   First, ensure you have `otool` installed (it is typically included in the Xcode Command Line Tools).

   ```bash
   xcode-select --install
   ```

2. **Use Python to run `otool`**:

   Here’s a Python script to list the imported libraries and symbols of a binary or dynamic library:

   ```python
   import subprocess

   # Specify the path to the executable or dylib
   binary_path = "/path/to/your/executable_or_library.dylib"

   # Run the 'otool -L' command to list linked libraries
   result = subprocess.run(['otool', '-L', binary_path], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, text=True)

   # Print the linked libraries
   print("Linked libraries:")
   print(result.stdout)

   # Run 'otool -T' to list symbols (imported APIs)
   result = subprocess.run(['otool', '-TV', binary_path], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, text=True)

   # Print the symbols
   print("Symbols (imported APIs):")
   print(result.stdout)
   ```

   This will display:
   - All libraries linked to the executable or dynamic library (`otool -L`).
   - The symbols imported by the executable (`otool -TV`).

### Option 2: Using `ctypes` to Load Libraries and Check Symbols

You can also dynamically load libraries in macOS using Python’s `ctypes` module and inspect functions:

```python
import ctypes

# Load the library
lib = ctypes.CDLL("/usr/lib/libSystem.dylib")

# Access a function (e.g., printf)
printf = lib.printf

# Use the function
printf(b"Hello, World from macOS!\n")
```

While this approach doesn’t give you a full list of all imported symbols like `otool`, it allows you to interact with specific functions in dynamic libraries using their function names.

### Option 3: Using `macholib`

You can also use the `macholib` Python package, which is specifically designed to parse Mach-O binaries (the executable format used on macOS). It can help you analyze the imports of a Mach-O file.

To install `macholib`, run:

```bash
pip install macholib
```

Then use it to inspect the imports:

```python
from macholib.MachO import MachO

# Path to the binary or dylib
binary_path = "/path/to/your/executable_or_library.dylib"

# Open and parse the Mach-O binary
m = MachO(binary_path)

# Iterate through the libraries
for header in m.headers:
    for load_command in header.commands:
        if load_command[0].get_cmd_name() == 'LC_LOAD_DYLIB':
            print(f"Imported library: {load_command[2]}")
```

This will list the imported dynamic libraries for the specified binary or `.dylib` file.

In summary, while macOS does not have a direct equivalent to Windows tools like `Get-Win32ModuleImport`, you can use tools like `otool` and Python libraries such as `ctypes` and `macholib` to inspect and interact with dynamic libraries on macOS.
