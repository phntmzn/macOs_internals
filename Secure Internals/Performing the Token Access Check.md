On macOS, while there isn't a direct equivalent to the **Token Access Check** as implemented in Windows, we can simulate the behavior by performing similar checks based on user privileges, group ownership, and system security attributes like **root privileges** and **file ownership**. These checks will determine whether the current user or process has special privileges to access or modify a resource.

We can simulate the **Token Access Check** in Python by performing:
1. **Privilege Checks**: Simulate checking if the process has root privileges or special access permissions.
2. **Ownership Checks**: Verify whether the current user owns the resource being accessed.

Here's how we can implement a **Token Access Check** in Python for macOS, using the principles described in the excerpt.

### Step 1: Privilege Check

We start by checking if the process has **root privileges** or any other special privilege that allows access to restricted resources.

```python
import os

def resolve_token_privilege_access(context):
    """
    Resolve token privilege access by checking if the process has special privileges
    (like root privileges). Modify the remaining access based on these privileges.
    """
    # Check if the process is running as root
    if os.geteuid() == 0:
        print("Process has root privileges, granting full access.")
        context['remaining_access'].clear()  # Clear all remaining access restrictions
        return True
    
    print("Process does not have root privileges.")
    return False
```

### Step 2: Ownership Check

We now check if the current user owns the resource. This will simulate whether the user’s token owns the resource, granting access based on ownership.

```python
import pwd

def resolve_token_owner_access(context):
    """
    Resolve token owner access by checking if the current user owns the resource.
    If the user owns the resource, grant full access.
    """
    file_stat = os.stat(context['filepath'])
    file_owner_uid = file_stat.st_uid
    
    # Get the current user's UID
    current_user_uid = os.getuid()

    if current_user_uid == file_owner_uid:
        print(f"User owns the resource {context['filepath']}, granting full access.")
        context['remaining_access'].clear()  # Clear all remaining access restrictions
        return True
    else:
        file_owner_name = pwd.getpwuid(file_owner_uid).pw_name
        print(f"User does not own the resource {context['filepath']}. Resource owned by {file_owner_name}.")
    
    return False
```

### Step 3: Token Access Check Function

We implement the **Token Access Check** that first checks for special privileges (like root access) and then checks ownership of the resource.

```python
def result_token_access(context):
    """
    Perform the token access check. First, resolve token privileges. If no access remains,
    return immediately. Otherwise, check resource ownership.
    """
    # Resolve token privileges
    if resolve_token_privilege_access(context):
        return True

    # If privileges don't grant access, resolve ownership access
    return resolve_token_owner_access(context)
```

### Step 4: Putting It All Together

Now we can test the **Token Access Check** by providing a file path and the access type the process is requesting. Based on whether the process has root privileges or owns the resource, access will be granted or denied.

```python
def test_token_access(filepath, access_type):
    # Create the context for the token access check
    context = {
        'filepath': filepath,
        'access_type': access_type,
        'remaining_access': set(access_type)  # Track the remaining access
    }

    # Perform the token access check
    if result_token_access(context):
        print(f"Access granted for {access_type} on {filepath}")
    else:
        if context['remaining_access']:
            print(f"Access denied for {access_type} on {filepath}")
        else:
            print(f"Full access granted for {access_type} on {filepath}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    filepath = '/path/to/your/resource'  # Replace with your file path
    access_type = ['read', 'write', 'execute']  # Example: the access types to check
    test_token_access(filepath, access_type)
```

### Explanation:

- **Privilege Check**: The `resolve_token_privilege_access` function checks if the process is running with **root privileges**. If the process has root privileges, it immediately grants full access to the resource.
- **Ownership Check**: The `resolve_token_owner_access` function checks if the current user owns the file or resource. If the user owns the resource, full access is granted.
- **Token Access Check**: The `result_token_access` function coordinates both checks. If any of the checks pass, access is granted.

### Example Output:

If the process is running as root:

```
Process has root privileges, granting full access.
Access granted for ['read', 'write', 'execute'] on /path/to/your/resource
```

If the process does not have root privileges and does not own the resource:

```
Process does not have root privileges.
User does not own the resource /path/to/your/resource. Resource owned by admin.
Access denied for ['read', 'write', 'execute'] on /path/to/your/resource
```

If the process does not have root privileges but owns the resource:

```
Process does not have root privileges.
User owns the resource /path/to/your/resource, granting full access.
Full access granted for ['read', 'write', 'execute'] on /path/to/your/resource
```

### Conclusion:

This Python script simulates a **Token Access Check** by checking for **root privileges** and **resource ownership** on macOS. By performing these checks, you can mimic how Windows handles token-based access control, determining whether the current user or process has the necessary permissions to access or modify a resource.

Would you like to expand this simulation further, such as incorporating more advanced privilege handling or integrating with macOS’s security frameworks?
