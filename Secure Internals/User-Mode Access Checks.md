On macOS, there is no direct equivalent to the **NtAccessCheck** system call from Windows. However, macOS provides its own mechanisms to perform **user-mode access checks** through **POSIX permissions** and **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**. In Python, you can perform access checks on files and directories using built-in modules such as `os`, `pwd`, and `grp`. These methods allow you to check if a user has permission to read, write, or execute a file, which can be viewed as an analog to access checks in macOS.

Here’s how you can simulate **user-mode access checks** in Python on macOS by:
1. Checking POSIX permissions and ACLs on files.
2. Verifying access for specific users or tokens.

### Example 1: Access Check for POSIX Permissions in Python

In this example, we’ll use Python to check if the calling process (or a specific user) has the appropriate permissions to access a file.

```python
import os

def check_access(filepath, access_type):
    # Check read, write, or execute access
    if access_type == 'read' and os.access(filepath, os.R_OK):
        print(f"Read access to {filepath} is granted.")
    elif access_type == 'write' and os.access(filepath, os.W_OK):
        print(f"Write access to {filepath} is granted.")
    elif access_type == 'execute' and os.access(filepath, os.X_OK):
        print(f"Execute access to {filepath} is granted.")
    else:
        print(f"Access to {filepath} is denied for {access_type} operation.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    filepath = '/path/to/your/file_or_directory'
    check_access(filepath, 'read')
    check_access(filepath, 'write')
    check_access(filepath, 'execute')
```

### Explanation:
- **`os.access()`**: This checks whether the calling process can access the file for the specified mode (`read`, `write`, or `execute`). This simulates a user-mode access check.
- **Access types**: You can specify the type of access to check: `'read'`, `'write'`, or `'execute'`.

### Example 2: Checking Ownership and Permissions for a Specific User

In macOS, permissions are tied to file ownership. You can also perform checks based on the user who owns the file by querying the **owner** and **group** of the file using Python.

```python
import os
import pwd
import grp

def check_user_access(filepath, username):
    # Get the file's stat structure
    file_stat = os.stat(filepath)
    
    # Get the file's owner and group
    file_owner_uid = file_stat.st_uid
    file_group_gid = file_stat.st_gid

    # Get the username and group information
    user_info = pwd.getpwnam(username)
    user_uid = user_info.pw_uid
    user_gid = user_info.pw_gid
    
    # Check if the user is the owner
    if file_owner_uid == user_uid:
        print(f"User '{username}' is the owner of the file '{filepath}'.")
        check_access(filepath, 'read')  # Check read access as an example
    elif file_group_gid == user_gid:
        print(f"User '{username}' belongs to the group that owns the file '{filepath}'.")
        check_access(filepath, 'read')
    else:
        print(f"User '{username}' is neither the owner nor in the group that owns the file.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    filepath = '/path/to/your/file_or_directory'
    username = 'john'  # Replace with the actual username to check
    check_user_access(filepath, username)
```

### Explanation:
- **`pwd.getpwnam(username)`**: Retrieves the UID and GID of the specified user.
- **Ownership check**: The code compares the file's UID and GID with the user’s UID and GID to determine if the user is the owner or belongs to the group that owns the file.
- **POSIX permission check**: Once ownership or group membership is determined, you can use `os.access()` to check specific permissions (e.g., read, write).

### Example 3: Using ACLs for Fine-Grained Access Control

In addition to POSIX permissions, macOS also supports **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**, which provide more fine-grained access control. While Python doesn’t have a built-in module to manipulate ACLs directly, you can use subprocesses to call macOS’s `chmod` and `ls` commands to work with ACLs.

#### Viewing ACLs on a File:

```bash
ls -le /path/to/your/file
```

#### Adding ACLs to a File Using `chmod`:

```bash
chmod +a "user:john allow read,write" /path/to/your/file
```

To integrate this into Python, you can use the `subprocess` module to call these commands.

### Example 4: Simulating User Token Access Using `subprocess`

Although macOS doesn’t have a concept of **impersonation tokens** like Windows, you can simulate access checks for different users using `sudo` to run commands as specific users.

#### Example: Running a Python Command as Another User Using `sudo`

```python
import subprocess

def run_as_user(username, command):
    # Run a command as another user using sudo
    result = subprocess.run(['sudo', '-u', username] + command, capture_output=True, text=True)
    print(result.stdout)
    print(result.stderr)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    run_as_user('john', ['ls', '-l', '/path/to/your/file'])
```

### Explanation:
- **`sudo -u username`**: Runs the specified command as the user `username`. This can simulate checking access for different users by running file operations or permission checks under different user accounts.

### Example 5: Working with System Calls in Python Using `ctypes`

If you want to go lower-level, you can use the `ctypes` library to interface with **libc** and call system-level APIs that simulate user-mode access checks, similar to how `NtAccessCheck` works in Windows.

Here’s an example of how you can call the **`access()`** system call from libc to check file access:

```python
import ctypes
import os

# Load the C standard library
libc = ctypes.CDLL("libc.dylib")

# Define the prototype of the access function
libc.access.argtypes = [ctypes.c_char_p, ctypes.c_int]
libc.access.restype = ctypes.c_int

def check_access_libc(filepath, mode):
    # Convert mode to appropriate flag
    if mode == 'read':
        access_mode = os.R_OK
    elif mode == 'write':
        access_mode = os.W_OK
    elif mode == 'execute':
        access_mode = os.X_OK
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid access mode")
    
    # Call the libc access() system call
    result = libc.access(filepath.encode('utf-8'), access_mode)
    
    if result == 0:
        print(f"Access granted for {mode} on {filepath}")
    else:
        print(f"Access denied for {mode} on {filepath}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    filepath = '/path/to/your/file'
    check_access_libc(filepath, 'read')
    check_access_libc(filepath, 'write')
    check_access_libc(filepath, 'execute')
```

### Explanation:
- **`libc.access()`**: This calls the system-level `access()` function to check for permissions.
- **Modes**: The modes correspond to `os.R_OK` (read), `os.W_OK` (write), and `os.X_OK` (execute).

### Conclusion:

While macOS does not have a direct equivalent to Windows' **NtAccessCheck**, the concepts of user-mode access checks can be replicated using Python by:
- Checking POSIX permissions using `os.access()`.
- Verifying ownership and group membership with `os.stat()`, `pwd`, and `grp`.
- Manipulating and checking ACLs through subprocesses.
- Running commands as different users using `sudo`.

These tools allow you to effectively manage access control in a manner similar to user-mode access checks in Windows.
