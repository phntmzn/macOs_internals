On macOS, we don't have an exact equivalent to Windows' Discretionary Access Control List (DACL) and Access Control Entries (ACEs), but we can simulate a similar **Discretionary Access Check** by leveraging **file permissions** and **ownership**. macOS uses **POSIX file permissions** and **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**, which define read, write, and execute permissions for the owner, group, and others.

### Step 1: Simulate the Discretionary Access Check

To simulate a **Discretionary Access Check**, we will:
1. Check file permissions.
2. Compare the current user’s access rights based on the file permissions and ownership.
3. Grant or deny access based on these permissions.

Here’s how we can implement this in Python:

### Step 2: Define the Discretionary Access Check

We will use Python’s `os` and `stat` modules to simulate a **DACL check**. These modules allow us to retrieve file permissions and ownership information.

```python
import os
import stat
import pwd

def get_discretionary_access(filepath, access_type):
    """
    Simulate the Discretionary Access Check by comparing file permissions and ownership.
    """
    # Get file stats
    file_stat = os.stat(filepath)
    
    # Get file permissions
    file_mode = file_stat.st_mode
    file_owner_uid = file_stat.st_uid
    file_group_gid = file_stat.st_gid

    # Get the current user's UID and GID
    current_user_uid = os.getuid()
    current_user_gid = os.getgid()

    # Determine the access the current user should have based on permissions
    permissions = {
        'read': False,
        'write': False,
        'execute': False
    }

    # Check if the current user is the owner of the file
    if current_user_uid == file_owner_uid:
        if file_mode & stat.S_IRUSR:  # Owner read
            permissions['read'] = True
        if file_mode & stat.S_IWUSR:  # Owner write
            permissions['write'] = True
        if file_mode & stat.S_IXUSR:  # Owner execute
            permissions['execute'] = True

    # Check if the current user belongs to the group of the file
    elif current_user_gid == file_group_gid:
        if file_mode & stat.S_IRGRP:  # Group read
            permissions['read'] = True
        if file_mode & stat.S_IWGRP:  # Group write
            permissions['write'] = True
        if file_mode & stat.S_IXGRP:  # Group execute
            permissions['execute'] = True

    # Check if the current user is "other" (everyone else)
    else:
        if file_mode & stat.S_IROTH:  # Others read
            permissions['read'] = True
        if file_mode & stat.S_IWOTH:  # Others write
            permissions['write'] = True
        if file_mode & stat.S_IXOTH:  # Others execute
            permissions['execute'] = True

    # Determine whether access is granted based on the requested access type
    access_granted = True
    for access in access_type:
        if not permissions.get(access, False):
            access_granted = False
            break

    return access_granted, permissions
```

### Step 3: Test the Discretionary Access Check

Now, let’s test the function to check if a user has the requested permissions on a file.

```python
def test_discretionary_access(filepath, access_type):
    access_granted, permissions = get_discretionary_access(filepath, access_type)
    
    print(f"Requested access: {access_type}")
    print(f"Permissions: {permissions}")
    
    if access_granted:
        print(f"Access granted for {access_type} on {filepath}")
    else:
        print(f"Access denied for {access_type} on {filepath}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    filepath = '/path/to/your/resource'  # Replace with the path to your file
    access_type = ['read', 'write']  # Example: the access types to check
    test_discretionary_access(filepath, access_type)
```

### Explanation:

- **Ownership and Permissions**: The script checks if the current user owns the file or is part of the file’s group. It then checks the appropriate file permissions for the owner, group, or others.
- **Access Type**: The `access_type` parameter specifies the requested access types (read, write, or execute). The function checks whether the current user has the necessary permissions for each requested access type.
- **Permissions Mapping**: The script builds a dictionary `permissions` that keeps track of whether the user has read, write, or execute permissions based on file ownership and mode.

### Example Output:

If the current user has read and write access:

```
Requested access: ['read', 'write']
Permissions: {'read': True, 'write': True, 'execute': False}
Access granted for ['read', 'write'] on /path/to/your/resource
```

If the current user does not have write access:

```
Requested access: ['read', 'write']
Permissions: {'read': True, 'write': False, 'execute': False}
Access denied for ['read', 'write'] on /path/to/your/resource
```

### Conclusion:

This Python script simulates a **Discretionary Access Check** by examining the file's ownership and permissions on macOS. It grants or denies access based on whether the user has the necessary permissions for the requested access type. While this isn't an exact match for Windows DACLs and ACEs, it provides a similar level of access control using POSIX permissions.

Would you like to extend this further, such as by adding support for macOS **ACLs** or more complex access control mechanisms?
