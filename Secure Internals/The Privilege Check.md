On macOS, we don’t have the exact equivalents of Windows' **privilege tokens** like **SeSecurityPrivilege**, **SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege**, or **SeRelabelPrivilege**, but we can simulate a similar **privilege check** by focusing on macOS-specific privileges, such as **root access** or **administrator access**. This Python implementation will approximate the behavior of these Windows privileges by checking if the process has root privileges and other file ownership-based permissions.

Here’s how we can simulate the **privilege check** in Python on macOS by checking for special privileges and removing access bits based on the user's privileges:

### Step 1: Define the Privilege Check

We can simulate the privilege check by examining whether the current process has root privileges or whether the user is allowed to modify the owner or security of the resource.

```python
import os

def resolve_token_privilege_access(context):
    """
    Resolve token privilege access by simulating special privileges (like root privileges).
    Adjust the remaining access based on privileges.
    """
    access = context['remaining_access']
    
    # Simulate SeSecurityPrivilege: check if the process is running as root
    if 'AccessSystemSecurity' in access and os.geteuid() == 0:
        print("Process has root privileges (simulated SeSecurityPrivilege), granting AccessSystemSecurity.")
        access.discard('AccessSystemSecurity')
        context['privileges'].append("SeSecurityPrivilege")
    
    # Simulate SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege: check if process can take ownership (root)
    if 'WriteOwner' in access and os.geteuid() == 0:
        print("Process has root privileges (simulated SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege), granting WriteOwner.")
        access.discard('WriteOwner')
        context['privileges'].append("SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege")
    
    # Simulate SeRelabelPrivilege: granting ownership if root
    if 'WriteOwner' in access and os.geteuid() == 0:
        print("Process has root privileges (simulated SeRelabelPrivilege), granting WriteOwner.")
        access.discard('WriteOwner')
        context['privileges'].append("SeRelabelPrivilege")
    
    context['remaining_access'] = access
```

### Step 2: Integrate the Privilege Check into the Token Access Check

Now, we integrate the privilege check into the token access check function. This will first check whether the process has any special privileges, and then it will determine if access can be granted based on these privileges.

```python
def result_token_access(context):
    """
    Perform the token access check. First, resolve token privileges.
    If no access remains, return immediately.
    """
    # Resolve token privileges
    resolve_token_privilege_access(context)

    # If all access bits have been removed (access granted), return True
    if not context['remaining_access']:
        print(f"Access fully granted based on privileges: {context['privileges']}")
        return True

    # If there are remaining access bits, check ownership (if needed)
    return resolve_token_owner_access(context)
```

### Step 3: Ownership Check (For Remaining Access)

If the privilege check does not grant all the necessary access, we fall back to checking the file ownership.

```python
import pwd

def resolve_token_owner_access(context):
    """
    Resolve token owner access by checking if the current user owns the resource.
    If the user owns the resource, grant access.
    """
    file_stat = os.stat(context['filepath'])
    file_owner_uid = file_stat.st_uid
    
    # Get the current user's UID
    current_user_uid = os.getuid()

    if current_user_uid == file_owner_uid:
        print(f"User owns the resource {context['filepath']}, granting full access.")
        context['remaining_access'].clear()  # Clear all remaining access restrictions
        return True
    else:
        file_owner_name = pwd.getpwuid(file_owner_uid).pw_name
        print(f"User does not own the resource {context['filepath']}. Resource owned by {file_owner_name}.")
    
    return False
```

### Step 4: Putting It All Together

Now, we can test the **privilege and token access check** by providing a file path and the access type the process is requesting. The system will first check if the process has root privileges (simulating **SeSecurityPrivilege**, **SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege**, and **SeRelabelPrivilege**), and then it will check if the user owns the file.

```python
def test_token_access(filepath, access_type):
    # Create the context for the token access check
    context = {
        'filepath': filepath,
        'access_type': access_type,
        'remaining_access': set(access_type),  # Track the remaining access
        'privileges': []  # Track which privileges were used to grant access
    }

    # Perform the token access check
    if result_token_access(context):
        print(f"Access granted for {access_type} on {filepath}")
    else:
        if context['remaining_access']:
            print(f"Access denied for {access_type} on {filepath}")
        else:
            print(f"Full access granted for {access_type} on {filepath}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    filepath = '/path/to/your/resource'  # Replace with your file path
    access_type = ['AccessSystemSecurity', 'WriteOwner']  # Example: the access types to check
    test_token_access(filepath, access_type)
```

### Explanation:

- **Privilege Check**: We simulate **SeSecurityPrivilege**, **SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege**, and **SeRelabelPrivilege** by checking whether the process is running with **root privileges**. If the process is running as root, it is granted the corresponding access rights (removing those from the remaining access).
- **Ownership Check**: If the privilege check does not grant all the necessary access, the script falls back to checking whether the current user owns the file. If the user owns the resource, they are granted full access.

### Example Output:

If the process is running as root and requests `AccessSystemSecurity` and `WriteOwner`:

```
Process has root privileges (simulated SeSecurityPrivilege), granting AccessSystemSecurity.
Process has root privileges (simulated SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege), granting WriteOwner.
Access fully granted based on privileges: ['SeSecurityPrivilege', 'SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege']
Access granted for ['AccessSystemSecurity', 'WriteOwner'] on /path/to/your/resource
```

If the process is not running as root and does not own the file:

```
Process does not have root privileges.
User does not own the resource /path/to/your/resource. Resource owned by admin.
Access denied for ['AccessSystemSecurity', 'WriteOwner'] on /path/to/your/resource
```

If the process owns the resource but does not have root privileges:

```
Process does not have root privileges.
User owns the resource /path/to/your/resource, granting full access.
Full access granted for ['AccessSystemSecurity', 'WriteOwner'] on /path/to/your/resource
```

### Conclusion:

This Python implementation simulates the **privilege check** from Windows by checking for root privileges and file ownership on macOS. If the process has root privileges, it is granted access, simulating the behavior of **SeSecurityPrivilege**, **SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege**, and **SeRelabelPrivilege**.

Would you like to add further features, such as more detailed access types or integrating with macOS's security frameworks for more advanced privilege handling?
