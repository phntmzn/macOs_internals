On macOS, **sandboxing** is a core security feature used to restrict what applications or processes can do based on predefined policies. These policies limit access to system resources, files, networks, and more. Apple's **App Sandbox** is a technology that implements this feature, and it is widely used in macOS applications.

Though macOS does not have the concept of **restricted tokens** or **lowbox tokens** like Windows, it does provide a way to sandbox processes using **Sandbox Profiles**. These profiles define what resources a process can access, based on rules written in a configuration file.

### Simulating Sandboxing in Python

While we can't directly implement **macOS sandboxing** in Python, we can simulate a restricted environment by using Python's capabilities to limit what files or resources can be accessed during the execution of the script. For a more direct interaction with macOS sandboxing, you would need to integrate with **macOS Sandbox APIs** or create sandbox profiles for applications.

However, we can simulate some sandbox-like restrictions in Python by:
1. **Limiting access to files or directories**.
2. **Controlling access to system resources**.

### Step 1: Using Python to Simulate a Sandboxed Environment

We can simulate sandboxing by enforcing restrictions programmatically using Python. For example, we can limit access to specific directories, prevent access to certain system calls, or restrict network access.

Here’s how to implement a simple sandbox simulation in Python by restricting file access:

```python
import os

class PythonSandbox:
    def __init__(self, allowed_paths=None):
        """
        Initialize the sandbox with a set of allowed paths.
        If allowed_paths is None, all paths are blocked.
        """
        self.allowed_paths = allowed_paths if allowed_paths is not None else []

    def check_access(self, path):
        """
        Check if the requested path is allowed.
        """
        for allowed_path in self.allowed_paths:
            if os.path.commonpath([allowed_path, path]) == allowed_path:
                return True
        return False

    def open_file(self, path, mode='r'):
        """
        Open a file if access is allowed.
        """
        if self.check_access(path):
            print(f"Access granted to open {path}")
            return open(path, mode)
        else:
            raise PermissionError(f"Access denied for {path}")

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Define the allowed paths for the sandbox
    allowed_paths = ['/Users/yourusername/Documents/safe_directory']

    # Create a sandbox instance with restricted access
    sandbox = PythonSandbox(allowed_paths=allowed_paths)

    # Try accessing files inside and outside the sandbox
    try:
        # This should succeed
        sandbox.open_file('/Users/yourusername/Documents/safe_directory/file.txt')

        # This should fail
        sandbox.open_file('/Users/yourusername/Documents/forbidden_directory/file.txt')
    except PermissionError as e:
        print(e)
```

### Step 2: Explain the Code

1. **Allowed Paths**: The `PythonSandbox` class accepts a list of directories where the sandboxed process is allowed to read and write files. Access outside these directories is blocked.
   
2. **File Access Check**: The `check_access` method compares the requested file path with the list of allowed paths. If the path is not within the allowed directories, access is denied.

3. **File Operations**: The `open_file` method is used to open a file, but only if the path is within the allowed sandbox. If the file is outside the allowed directory, a `PermissionError` is raised.

### Example Output:

```
Access granted to open /Users/yourusername/Documents/safe_directory/file.txt
Access denied for /Users/yourusername/Documents/forbidden_directory/file.txt
```

### Step 3: More Advanced Sandboxing

For a more advanced sandboxing setup on macOS, you would typically interact with macOS **Sandbox Profiles** using **App Sandbox** or **Sandbox extensions**. The sandboxing feature provided by macOS allows you to define what files, network resources, and system services the process can access.

To create a more advanced sandbox environment in macOS, you would:
- **Define a sandbox profile**: This is a plist or sandbox configuration file that defines the policies for what the process can and cannot access.
- **Use system-level APIs**: You can call macOS sandbox APIs to apply a profile to a running process.

For example, here’s a simplified sandbox profile:

```shell
(version 1)
(deny default)
(allow file-read* (subpath "/Users/yourusername/Documents/safe_directory"))
(deny network*)
```

This profile denies all access by default, but allows the process to read files in `/Users/yourusername/Documents/safe_directory` and blocks all network access.

### Step 4: Python and macOS Sandbox API

Python cannot directly create macOS **Sandbox Profiles**, but you can use **Objective-C** or **C** to integrate with macOS sandbox APIs. One approach would be to call these APIs using **ctypes** or **PyObjC** in Python, though this would require more in-depth knowledge of macOS internals and Objective-C.

### Conclusion:

This Python sandbox simulation allows you to restrict file access based on predefined rules, similar to a restricted token in Windows. For more complex sandboxing, such as limiting system calls or network access, you would need to interact with macOS-specific sandboxing features like **App Sandbox** or **Sandbox Profiles**.
