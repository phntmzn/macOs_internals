On macOS, there is no direct equivalent to Windows' **Access Filter ACE** or the conditional access filtering mechanism used in Security Access Control Lists (SACLs). However, macOS uses similar concepts such as **System Integrity Protection (SIP)**, **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)**, and **sandboxing** to control access based on specific conditions. While these mechanisms do not provide the same conditional expressions as Access Filter ACEs, we can simulate similar behavior in Python by checking security conditions, such as user privileges, SIP status, or whether the process is sandboxed.

To simulate **Access Filter ACE** behavior on macOS using Python, we can:
1. **Check system conditions** (e.g., SIP or root access) to determine if access should be restricted.
2. **Implement conditional checks** for access restrictions based on specific attributes of the process or user.

Hereâ€™s how we can build an access filter system that behaves similarly to Windows' Access Filter ACE in Python on macOS.

### Step 1: Define Conditional Access Filter Check

In this step, we define the conditional access check that restricts access based on whether specific system conditions (e.g., SIP protection or sandboxing) evaluate to `True` or `False`.

```python
import os
import subprocess

class AccessFilterContext:
    def __init__(self, filepath, access_type, conditions):
        self.filepath = filepath
        self.access_type = access_type
        self.conditions = conditions
        self.access_mask = 0xFFFFFFFF  # Start with full access
        self.remaining_access = set(access_type)

    def has_remaining_access(self):
        return len(self.remaining_access) > 0

def test_access_filter(context):
    """
    Perform access filtering based on the provided conditions.
    """
    # Loop through each condition and apply it
    for condition in context.conditions:
        # If condition is False, restrict the access mask
        if not condition():
            # Apply restrictive access (e.g., read-only or limited)
            print("Condition failed, restricting access.")
            context.access_mask &= 0x00000001  # Restrict to read-only or limited access
            context.remaining_access.discard('write')
            context.remaining_access.discard('execute')
    
    # After filtering, check if remaining access is valid
    return context.has_remaining_access()
```

### Step 2: Implement Sample Conditions

Next, we define sample conditions that simulate the behavior of an Access Filter ACE. For example, we could check whether **SIP** is enabled or whether the process is running with **root privileges**.

#### Condition 1: Check System Integrity Protection (SIP)

```python
def check_sip_status():
    """
    Check if System Integrity Protection (SIP) is enabled.
    Returns True if SIP is enabled, False otherwise.
    """
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(['csrutil', 'status'], capture_output=True, text=True)
        if "enabled" in result.stdout:
            print("SIP is enabled.")
            return True
        else:
            print("SIP is not enabled.")
            return False
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("csrutil command not found, assuming SIP is disabled.")
        return False
```

#### Condition 2: Check Root Privileges

```python
def check_root_privileges():
    """
    Check if the process is running as root.
    Returns True if running as root, False otherwise.
    """
    if os.geteuid() == 0:
        print("Process is running as root.")
        return True
    else:
        print("Process is not running as root.")
        return False
```

#### Condition 3: Check Sandboxing Status

```python
def check_sandbox_status():
    """
    Check if the process is running in a sandboxed environment.
    Returns True if sandboxed, False otherwise.
    """
    try:
        # Try to access a system-protected file to simulate sandbox restriction
        with open('/System/Library/CoreServices', 'r'):
            pass
    except PermissionError:
        print("Process is sandboxed (restricted access).")
        return True
    except Exception:
        pass

    print("Process is not sandboxed.")
    return False
```

### Step 3: Putting It All Together

We combine the access filter context with the conditions to simulate how access is granted or restricted based on the results of these conditions.

```python
def test_access(filepath, access_type):
    # Define conditions for the access filter
    conditions = [
        check_sip_status,     # SIP status check
        check_root_privileges,  # Root privilege check
        check_sandbox_status   # Sandboxing status check
    ]
    
    # Create the access filter context
    context = AccessFilterContext(filepath, access_type, conditions)
    
    # Perform the access filter test
    if test_access_filter(context):
        print(f"Access granted for {access_type} on {filepath}")
    else:
        print(f"Access denied for {access_type} on {filepath}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    filepath = '/path/to/your/file'
    access_type = ['read', 'write', 'execute']  # Example access types
    test_access(filepath, access_type)
```

### Explanation:

- **Access Filter Context**: The `AccessFilterContext` holds information about the file, the desired access type (read, write, execute), and the conditions that need to be checked.
- **Conditions**: The script defines three conditions: SIP status, root privileges, and sandbox status. These conditions are analogous to the conditional expressions in Windows' Access Filter ACE.
- **Access Restriction**: If any of the conditions fail, the access mask is restricted. For example, failing the SIP check or not running as root could restrict access to read-only.

### Step 4: Testing the Access Filter

You can test the script by providing a file path and access type. Depending on the results of the conditions, the script will either grant or deny access.

```bash
python3 access_filter.py
```

### Example Output:

```
SIP is enabled.
Process is not running as root.
Process is sandboxed (restricted access).
Condition failed, restricting access.
Access denied for ['read', 'write', 'execute'] on /path/to/your/file
```

If the conditions pass, you may see something like:

```
SIP is enabled.
Process is running as root.
Process is not sandboxed.
Access granted for ['read', 'write', 'execute'] on /path/to/your/file
```

### Conclusion:

By simulating conditional access checks using system conditions (such as SIP status, root privileges, and sandboxing), this Python script mimics the behavior of Windows' **Access Filter ACE**. While macOS does not natively support Access Filter ACEs, these techniques provide a way to control access based on system security conditions.

Would you like to expand the script with more conditions or add more complex access control scenarios?
