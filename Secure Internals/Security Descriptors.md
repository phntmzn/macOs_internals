To access and query security descriptors on Windows using Python, you would typically rely on the Windows API. Python libraries like `ctypes` or `pywin32` can be used to call these system functions such as `NtQuerySecurityObject`. On macOS, however, such low-level Windows-specific operations are not possible directly because the operating system does not use the same security model (i.e., Security Identifiers or SIDs, DACLs, SACLs, etc.).

If you're specifically interested in replicating security descriptor querying (as in your PowerShell example) in a cross-platform Python environment or on macOS, the closest equivalent would be using macOS's permission and access control model (POSIX, ACLs). However, querying such security-related attributes on macOS will not involve anything like SIDs or Windows-style security descriptors.

Here’s a quick overview of what you can do on macOS using Python to interact with file and process permissions:

### Example: Querying File Permissions and ACLs on macOS

You can use Python's `os` module or third-party libraries to read permissions and access control lists (ACLs) on macOS.

```python
import os
import subprocess

def get_file_permissions(filepath):
    # Get standard file permissions
    stat_info = os.stat(filepath)
    return {
        'Owner UID': stat_info.st_uid,
        'Group GID': stat_info.st_gid,
        'Permissions': oct(stat_info.st_mode)[-3:]
    }

def get_file_acls(filepath):
    # Get ACLs (Access Control Lists) using the system's 'ls' command
    result = subprocess.run(['ls', '-le', filepath], capture_output=True, text=True)
    return result.stdout

if __name__ == '__main__':
    filepath = '/path/to/your/file'

    permissions = get_file_permissions(filepath)
    print("File Permissions:", permissions)

    acls = get_file_acls(filepath)
    print("File ACLs:", acls)
```

### Explanation:
- `os.stat()` retrieves file metadata, including ownership and permissions.
- The command `ls -le` is used to view extended file ACLs in macOS.

While this does not directly compare to querying Windows security descriptors, it gives you a way to look at file access control in a Unix-like system.

For working with Windows-specific security APIs like `NtQuerySecurityObject` or `Get-NtSecurityDescriptor`, you would need to be on a Windows machine and use Python with libraries like `pywin32`. Here's a basic example for querying a file's security descriptor on Windows:

### Example: Querying Security Descriptors on Windows using Python (pywin32)

```python
import win32security
import ntsecuritycon as con

def get_file_security_descriptor(filepath):
    # Open the file with read control
    sd = win32security.GetFileSecurity(filepath, con.OWNER_SECURITY_INFORMATION | con.DACL_SECURITY_INFORMATION)
    
    owner_sid = sd.GetSecurityDescriptorOwner()
    dacl = sd.GetSecurityDescriptorDacl()

    print("Owner SID:", win32security.ConvertSidToStringSid(owner_sid))
    
    if dacl:
        for i in range(dacl.GetAceCount()):
            ace = dacl.GetAce(i)
            print(f"ACE {i}:")
            print(f"  SID: {win32security.ConvertSidToStringSid(ace[2])}")
            print(f"  Access Mask: {ace[1]}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    filepath = r"C:\path\to\your\file"
    get_file_security_descriptor(filepath)
```

### Explanation:
- This script uses `pywin32` to interact with Windows security descriptors.
- `win32security.GetFileSecurity` retrieves the security descriptor for a given file.
- The script prints out the file's owner and its DACL (Discretionary Access Control List).
