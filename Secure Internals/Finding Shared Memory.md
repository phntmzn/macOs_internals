On macOS, there isn’t an exact equivalent to the Windows `Get-NtHandle` command or direct access to kernel objects such as Sections. However, you can investigate shared resources like file descriptors and shared memory segments using various macOS tools such as `lsof`, `ipcs`, and `dtrace` for process interaction.

Here’s how you could find shared memory segments and processes that share file descriptors or other resources using `ipcs`, `lsof`, and Python.

### Python Example for Finding Shared Memory on macOS

You can use the `ipcs` command to list shared memory, message queues, and semaphores, and `lsof` to check file descriptors shared between processes.

```python
import subprocess

# Find all shared memory segments using ipcs
def find_shared_memory():
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(['ipcs', '-m'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, text=True)
        print("Shared memory segments:")
        print(result.stdout)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error finding shared memory: {e}")

# Find processes with shared file descriptors using lsof
def find_shared_file_descriptors(name_filter):
    try:
        # Run the lsof command to list all open files
        result = subprocess.run(['lsof'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, text=True)

        # Filter lines that match the name filter
        matching_lines = [line for line in result.stdout.splitlines() if name_filter in line]

        # Group by process ID and print
        process_dict = {}
        for line in matching_lines:
            columns = line.split()
            process_id = columns[1]
            process_name = columns[0]
            file_descriptor = columns[3]
            file_name = columns[-1]
            
            if process_id not in process_dict:
                process_dict[process_id] = {"process_name": process_name, "file_descriptors": []}
            
            process_dict[process_id]["file_descriptors"].append({
                "file_descriptor": file_descriptor,
                "file_name": file_name
            })
        
        for pid, info in process_dict.items():
            print(f"Process ID: {pid}, Process Name: {info['process_name']}")
            for fd_info in info["file_descriptors"]:
                print(f"  FD: {fd_info['file_descriptor']}, File: {fd_info['file_name']}")
    
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error finding shared file descriptors: {e}")

# Example usage:
find_shared_memory()  # List all shared memory segments
find_shared_file_descriptors("System")  # Example to find shared files with "System" in their name
```

### Explanation:
1. **`ipcs` for Shared Memory**: The `ipcs -m` command lists all shared memory segments, which could be used for inter-process communication (IPC). This is analogous to finding shared Section objects in Windows.
2. **`lsof` for File Descriptors**: The `lsof` command is used to list all open file descriptors for processes. We filter and group by process ID to find shared resources, similar to how you would find shared handles in Windows.
3. **Group and Filter**: The script groups shared file descriptors by process ID, giving insight into processes that share common resources.

### Equivalent Functionality:
- **Shared Memory Segments (ipcs)**: This is somewhat analogous to shared sections in Windows. Processes that share memory can be found using the `ipcs` command.
- **Shared File Descriptors (lsof)**: Finding shared file descriptors between processes using `lsof` is akin to finding shared kernel objects by name or handle in Windows.

This Python script provides similar functionality to finding shared Section objects on Windows, adapted for macOS, using tools like `ipcs` and `lsof` to find shared memory and file descriptors between processes.
