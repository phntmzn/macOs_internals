On macOS, you can find writable and executable memory regions in a process using the `vmmap` tool, which is built into the operating system. `vmmap` provides detailed information about a process's memory, including regions that are marked as both writable and executable. To mimic the behavior in the Windows example, you can use Python's `subprocess` to call `vmmap` and filter the memory regions.

### Python Example for Finding Writable and Executable Memory in macOS

```python
import subprocess

# Function to find writable and executable memory regions
def find_writable_executable_memory(pid):
    try:
        # Run the vmmap command to get memory details for the process
        result = subprocess.run(['vmmap', str(pid)], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, text=True)

        # Filter for regions that are marked as both writable and executable
        print("Writable and Executable Memory Regions:")
        for line in result.stdout.splitlines():
            if "rwx" in line:  # rwx means readable, writable, and executable
                print(line)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error finding writable and executable memory: {e}")

# Example usage: Replace with the process ID (pid) you want to check
process_id = 1234  # Example PID, replace with actual process ID
find_writable_executable_memory(process_id)
```

### Explanation:
1. **`vmmap`**: This is a built-in macOS tool that provides a detailed report of the memory usage of a process. It includes information about protection levels, including whether memory is writable and executable (`rwx`).
2. **Filtering**: The script filters the output of `vmmap` to find memory regions that are marked as both writable and executable, which could indicate a potential security risk.
3. **Subprocess**: The `subprocess.run()` function is used to execute `vmmap` and capture its output for analysis.

### Equivalent Functionality:
- **Writable and Executable Memory Regions**: The `vmmap` tool is used to analyze memory protection settings for a given process, similar to how you would use `Get-NtVirtualMemory` in Windows.
- **Filtering**: The script filters for memory regions that are marked as `rwx` (readable, writable, and executable), analogous to searching for `ExecuteReadWrite` in the Windows example.

This Python script provides a way to find writable and executable memory regions in a process on macOS, similar to how you would check for `ExecuteReadWrite` memory regions in a Windows process.
