In macOS, memory management and system calls differ from the Windows-specific calls mentioned like `NtAllocateVirtualMemory`, `NtQueryVirtualMemory`, and `NtWriteVirtualMemory`. However, you can achieve similar memory management tasks on macOS using built-in Unix tools and system calls available in the kernel, especially through `bash`.

Here’s a mapping of how you can handle memory-related tasks in macOS with `bash`:

1. **Viewing Process Virtual Memory:**
   To view the virtual memory usage of processes, you can use the `vm_stat` command to display statistics about virtual memory usage:
   ```bash
   vm_stat
   ```

   You can also use `top` to see per-process memory statistics:
   ```bash
   top -o mem
   ```

2. **Viewing Memory Usage for a Specific Process:**
   You can use `ps` with flags to display detailed memory information:
   ```bash
   ps -o pid,rss,vsize,comm -p <pid>
   ```

   Here, `rss` represents the resident set size (physical memory usage), and `vsize` represents the virtual memory size.

3. **Monitoring Swap (Similar to Windows Pagefile):**
   macOS uses swap files to manage memory beyond the available physical RAM, much like the pagefile in Windows. You can monitor swap usage with:
   ```bash
   sysctl vm.swapusage
   ```

4. **Allocating and Freeing Memory:**
   In macOS, memory allocations at a low level are typically handled by system calls such as `mmap` and `munmap` for allocating and freeing memory regions. You can interact with these calls in C programs, but `bash` doesn’t provide direct memory allocation functions. You would typically handle memory through higher-level languages (like C or Python) on macOS.

5. **Changing Memory Protection:**
   To change memory protection on macOS, the `mprotect` system call is used in C or other programming languages. Like memory allocation, this is not directly possible through `bash`, but you can manipulate memory regions at a low level with tools like `lldb` (a debugger):
   ```bash
   lldb -- <process_name>
   ```

6. **Checking Total Memory Information:**
   You can get system-wide memory usage and information using the `sysctl` command:
   ```bash
   sysctl hw.memsize
   ```

   This command shows the total physical memory (RAM) in bytes.

7. **Using Instruments or Activity Monitor:**
   For advanced memory inspection, including virtual memory usage, you can use macOS's Activity Monitor or Instruments app (part of Xcode).

While macOS doesn’t have direct equivalents for Windows NT memory management calls like `NtAllocateVirtualMemory` or `NtReadVirtualMemory`, these shell commands and system utilities provide insight into virtual memory and process memory usage on macOS.
