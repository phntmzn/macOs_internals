The equivalent of the Windows-specific process described above (loading a library and getting function addresses using APIs like `LoadLibrary` and `GetProcAddress`) doesn't directly apply to macOS, as macOS uses a Unix-based system with its own dynamic library handling. However, you can achieve similar functionality in Python on macOS using the `ctypes` module or `CDLL` to interact with shared libraries (which are typically `.dylib` files on macOS, similar to `.dll` files on Windows).

Here’s how you can load a dynamic library and retrieve the address of an exported function using `ctypes` in Python on macOS:

### Example: Loading a Shared Library in macOS

1. **Load the Shared Library:**

   ```python
   import ctypes

   # Load a shared library (for example, libc.dylib)
   libc = ctypes.CDLL("/usr/lib/libc.dylib")
   ```

2. **Access a Function:**

   Once the library is loaded, you can use `getattr` or directly access functions by name:

   ```python
   # Accessing the 'printf' function from libc
   printf = libc.printf

   # Use the function
   printf(b"Hello, %s!\n", b"World")
   ```

3. **Defining the Argument and Return Types:**

   You can specify the argument types and return type of the function using `argtypes` and `restype` to prevent Python from misinterpreting the values:

   ```python
   # Define argument types and return type for printf
   printf.argtypes = [ctypes.c_char_p]
   printf.restype = ctypes.c_int

   # Call the function
   printf(b"Hello, macOS!\n")
   ```

### Example: Using `dlopen` and `dlsym` for More Low-Level Control

If you need lower-level control, you can use `dlopen` and `dlsym`, which are the macOS (and Unix) equivalents of `LoadLibrary` and `GetProcAddress`.

1. **Use `dlopen` to Load the Library:**

   ```python
   import ctypes
   from ctypes.util import find_library

   # Locate and load a shared library
   libc_path = find_library("c")  # This will find libc
   libc = ctypes.CDLL(libc_path)
   ```

2. **Use `dlsym` to Find Function Addresses:**

   After loading the library, you can use `dlsym` to get the memory address of functions:

   ```python
   # Get a pointer to a function (e.g., printf)
   printf_ptr = libc.printf

   # Call the function
   printf_ptr(b"Direct address call to printf\n")
   ```

### macOS Specific System Libraries

In macOS, you can interact with system-level APIs using frameworks like *CoreFoundation* and *Foundation* via `ctypes` or `PyObjC`. These frameworks expose many of the system functionalities analogous to what `kernel32.dll` provides in Windows.

For example, macOS has `libSystem.dylib`, which contains many POSIX functions that you can load in a similar way.

If you're working with specific system-level functionalities that involve interacting with dynamic libraries or low-level APIs in macOS, this approach using `ctypes` should cover most needs similar to how it's done in Windows using `LoadLibrary` and `GetProcAddress`.
