On macOS, there is no direct equivalent to Windows' Advanced Local Procedure Call (ALPC). However, inter-process communication (IPC) on macOS can be achieved through several mechanisms, such as Mach ports (used for messaging between processes), sockets, pipes, or XPC (a higher-level API for communication between services). Below is an example of how you can implement local cross-process communication using **Mach ports** in Python.

### Python Example for Cross-Process Communication on macOS (Using Mach Ports)

Mach ports are a lower-level IPC mechanism used in macOS for sending and receiving messages between processes. Hereâ€™s how you can set up basic communication using `multiprocessing` (as an analogy for ALPC in Windows):

```python
import multiprocessing

# Server function (equivalent to NtCreateAlpcPort)
def server(conn):
    message = conn.recv()  # Receive message from the client
    print(f"Server received: {message}")
    conn.send(f"Message '{message}' received!")  # Respond back to the client

# Client function (equivalent to NtConnectAlpcPort)
def client(conn):
    message = "Hello, Server!"
    print(f"Client sending: {message}")
    conn.send(message)  # Send message to the server
    response = conn.recv()  # Receive response from the server
    print(f"Client received: {response}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create a pipe for communication between client and server
    parent_conn, child_conn = multiprocessing.Pipe()

    # Start the server process
    server_process = multiprocessing.Process(target=server, args=(child_conn,))
    server_process.start()

    # The client communicates through the parent connection
    client(parent_conn)

    # Close the server
    server_process.join()
```

### Explanation:
1. **`multiprocessing.Pipe()`**: This creates a communication channel (analogous to an ALPC port) that allows sending and receiving messages between two processes.
2. **`conn.send()` and `conn.recv()`**: These are used to send and receive discrete messages, similar to how ALPC works in Windows.
3. **Server and Client**: The server listens for messages and sends responses, while the client initiates communication.

### Higher-Level IPC (XPC):
For more complex communication, you could use macOS's **XPC** (similar to ALPC but at a higher level). However, XPC requires more advanced setup in a macOS app development environment, often written in Objective-C or Swift.

This Python example demonstrates a basic implementation of cross-process communication on macOS using pipes, analogous to ALPC's message-passing mechanism in Windows.
