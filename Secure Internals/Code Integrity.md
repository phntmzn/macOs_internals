Here’s how you can achieve similar functionality in macOS using Python to check for code integrity, focusing on file signatures. While macOS doesn’t have an exact equivalent to Windows’ `Get-AuthenticodeSignature`, you can use system tools like `codesign` to verify whether executables or binaries are signed and trusted.

### Python Example for Checking Code Integrity on macOS

In macOS, you can use the `subprocess` module to run the `codesign` command to verify an app’s signature.

```python
import subprocess

def check_code_integrity(file_path):
    # Use codesign to check if the file is signed
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(["codesign", "--verify", "--verbose=2", file_path],
                                stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, text=True)

        # Check the return code to determine the integrity status
        if result.returncode == 0:
            print(f"Signature for {file_path} is valid.")
        else:
            print(f"Signature for {file_path} is invalid or missing.")
            print(result.stderr)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error checking signature: {e}")

# Path to the binary you want to check
file_path = "/Applications/Calculator.app"
check_code_integrity(file_path)
```

### Explanation:
1. **`codesign --verify`**: This checks whether the app is signed and whether the signature is valid.
2. **`result.returncode == 0`**: A return code of 0 means that the signature is valid.
3. **Error handling**: If the signature is invalid or missing, the error output is captured and displayed.

This example mirrors the code integrity checks in Windows, adapted for macOS.

This Python script uses macOS's native `codesign` command to perform code integrity checks, analogous to querying the Authenticode signature in Windows.
