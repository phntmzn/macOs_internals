Here is how you can perform similar memory operations on macOS using Python. While macOS doesn't have direct equivalents for the Windows-specific system calls used in your excerpt, you can work with memory through Python using libraries like `mmap` for memory-mapped files and system tools for monitoring memory. Here's an example of how you could perform operations similar to `NtVirtualMemory` commands using Python on macOS:

### Python Example for Memory Operations on macOS

1. **Allocating and Mapping Virtual Memory:**

   Python provides the `mmap` module to map files or devices into memory. Here's an example of how to allocate and manipulate memory.

   ```python
   import mmap

   # Creating an anonymous memory map
   mm = mmap.mmap(-1, 4096)  # Allocate 4KB (minimum page size)

   # Write to memory
   mm.write(b'\x01\x02\x03\x04')

   # Seek to the beginning and read the memory
   mm.seek(0)
   data = mm.read(4)
   print(f"Memory Content: {list(data)}")  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

   # Change memory protection (not directly in Python but through `mmap`)
   # You can set it to read-only by closing and reopening with appropriate flags.
   mm.close()
   ```

2. **Reading and Writing to Memory:**

   You can use Pythonâ€™s `mmap` library to read and write to memory. Here's an example:

   ```python
   with open("/tmp/testfile", "wb") as f:
       f.write(b"\x00" * 4096)  # Create a file for memory-mapped IO

   with open("/tmp/testfile", "r+b") as f:
       mm = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 4096)

       # Write data to memory
       mm.seek(0)
       mm.write(b'\x01\x02\x03\x04')

       # Read data from memory
       mm.seek(0)
       data = mm.read(4)
       print(f"Memory Content After Write: {list(data)}")  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

       mm.close()
   ```

3. **Getting Virtual Memory Information (Similar to `Get-NtVirtualMemory`):**

   While macOS doesn't have a direct equivalent of `Get-NtVirtualMemory`, you can get virtual memory statistics using Python's `os` and `psutil` libraries.

   ```python
   import psutil

   # Get virtual memory stats
   memory_info = psutil.virtual_memory()
   print(f"Total Memory: {memory_info.total}")
   print(f"Available Memory: {memory_info.available}")
   print(f"Used Memory: {memory_info.used}")
   print(f"Percentage Used: {memory_info.percent}%")
   ```

4. **Removing Memory (Analogous to `Remove-NtVirtualMemory`):**

   In Python, you can unmap memory using the `close` method of the `mmap` object, as shown in the earlier example with `mm.close()`. This frees the allocated memory.
