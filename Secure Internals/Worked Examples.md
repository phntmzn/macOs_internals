On macOS, while PowerShell isn't typically the default environment, you can achieve similar functionality using shell scripting, Python, or AppleScript, depending on the task. In macOS, worked examples can be created around common commands like `defaults`, `codesign`, `security`, and other command-line utilities for system configuration, security, and automation.

### Python Example for macOS Security and Automation

Letâ€™s repurpose various commands to demonstrate how you can experiment with security and configuration on macOS. This Python script demonstrates reading system configurations, checking code integrity, and automating tasks, similar to what you'd do with PowerShell in Windows.

```python
import subprocess
import os

# Example 1: Check code integrity of a binary (similar to `Get-AuthenticodeSignature`)
def check_code_sign(file_path):
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(['codesign', '--verify', '--verbose=2', file_path], 
                                stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, text=True)
        if result.returncode == 0:
            print(f"{file_path} is properly signed.")
        else:
            print(f"{file_path} signature verification failed.")
            print(result.stderr)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error checking code sign: {e}")

# Example 2: Change system settings (similar to modifying the Windows registry)
def change_finder_settings():
    try:
        # Read current setting (whether hidden files are shown)
        result = subprocess.run(['defaults', 'read', 'com.apple.finder', 'AppleShowAllFiles'], 
                                stdout=subprocess.PIPE, text=True)
        print(f"Current Finder setting for showing hidden files: {result.stdout.strip()}")

        # Toggle the setting to show hidden files
        subprocess.run(['defaults', 'write', 'com.apple.finder', 'AppleShowAllFiles', 'TRUE'])
        print("Finder set to show hidden files.")
        
        # Restart Finder to apply changes
        subprocess.run(['killall', 'Finder'])
        print("Finder restarted to apply settings.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error changing Finder settings: {e}")

# Example 3: Scan for security vulnerabilities (like using system info to spot issues)
def scan_system_logs():
    try:
        # Scan system logs for security-related keywords
        result = subprocess.run(['log', 'show', '--predicate', 'eventMessage contains "security"'], 
                                stdout=subprocess.PIPE, text=True)
        print("Recent security-related log entries:")
        print(result.stdout[:500])  # Only show the first 500 characters for brevity
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error scanning system logs: {e}")

# Main function to demonstrate examples
def main():
    # Example 1: Check code sign for an application
    check_code_sign("/Applications/Calculator.app")

    # Example 2: Change Finder settings to show hidden files
    change_finder_settings()

    # Example 3: Scan system logs for security-related events
    scan_system_logs()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Code Signing (Example 1)**: Similar to the `Get-AuthenticodeSignature` command in PowerShell, this Python function checks if an application is properly signed using the `codesign` command.
2. **System Settings (Example 2)**: This function uses the `defaults` command to read and modify system settings, similar to working with the Windows registry in PowerShell.
3. **System Logs (Example 3)**: A simple example to show how you can scan macOS system logs for security-related issues.

### Worked Example Concept:
These worked examples show how you can take basic commands available in macOS and use them for automation, security checks, and configuration management, similar to how you might modify PowerShell scripts in Windows for security research or system management tasks.

This Python script uses built-in macOS tools to provide similar functionality to Windows PowerShell examples, with security checks, system configuration, and automation tasks adapted for the macOS environment.
