To achieve a similar SID enumeration process using Python on macOS, you'll need to approach this from a different angle because PowerShell and Windows-specific functions such as `Get-NtSid` are not available on macOS. Instead, Python can utilize system calls and libraries to query system information.

While Python cannot directly query LSASS or use Windows-specific methods, you can still work with user and group information using standard libraries like `os`, `pwd`, and `grp` on Unix-like systems (like macOS). These can enumerate user and group identifiers (UIDs and GIDs), which is somewhat analogous to SIDs in the Unix context.

Here's a basic Python script to enumerate users and groups on macOS:

```python
import pwd
import grp

def enumerate_users():
    # Enumerating users (like SID to Name mappings)
    users = pwd.getpwall()
    user_info = []
    
    for user in users:
        user_info.append({
            'Name': user.pw_name,
            'UID': user.pw_uid,
            'GID': user.pw_gid,
            'Home Directory': user.pw_dir,
            'Shell': user.pw_shell
        })
    
    return user_info

def enumerate_groups():
    # Enumerating groups (like SID to Name mappings for groups)
    groups = grp.getgrall()
    group_info = []
    
    for group in groups:
        group_info.append({
            'Group Name': group.gr_name,
            'GID': group.gr_gid,
            'Members': group.gr_mem
        })
    
    return group_info

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print("Enumerating Users:")
    for user in enumerate_users():
        print(user)

    print("\nEnumerating Groups:")
    for group in enumerate_groups():
        print(group)
```

### Explanation:
- `pwd.getpwall()` returns a list of all user accounts on the system.
- `grp.getgrall()` returns a list of all groups on the system.
- The script outputs basic information about users and groups, which is conceptually similar to what the PowerShell script does for SIDs.

This won't give you SIDs like in a Windows environment, but for macOS, UIDs and GIDs are the closest equivalents. For full SID enumeration in a Windows environment using Python, you would need to interact with the Windows API, which is outside the scope of macOS Python scripts.

Would you like more detailed information on cross-platform approaches or ways to potentially connect Python to Windows APIs remotely?
