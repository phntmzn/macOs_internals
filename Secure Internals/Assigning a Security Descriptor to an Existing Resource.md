In Windows, assigning a **security descriptor** to an existing resource (such as a file, directory, or registry key) involves modifying the **DACL (Discretionary Access Control List)** and **SACL (System Access Control List)** for that resource. This allows you to change who has access to the resource and what actions they are permitted to perform.

On macOS, although it doesn't have security descriptors like Windows, you can assign or modify permissions and **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** for existing resources (like files or directories) to control access in a similar way. This can be done using the `chmod` command or through Python by calling system commands to change ownership, permissions, and ACLs.

### Example: Assigning or Modifying ACLs for an Existing Resource on macOS

In this example, you will assign a new ACL to an existing file or directory to control access.

```python
import os
import subprocess

def assign_acl_to_existing_resource(filepath, acl_rule):
    # Apply ACL to the existing file or directory
    subprocess.run(['chmod', '+a', acl_rule, filepath], check=True)
    print(f"ACL rule '{acl_rule}' applied to resource '{filepath}'")

def check_acl(filepath):
    # Check the ACLs on the file or directory
    result = subprocess.run(['ls', '-le', filepath], capture_output=True, text=True)
    print(f"Current ACLs for '{filepath}':")
    print(result.stdout)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    filepath = '/path/to/your/existing_resource'
    
    # Define an ACL rule (e.g., allowing the 'admin' group to read, write, and execute)
    acl_rule = "group:admin allow read,write,execute"
    
    # Apply the ACL to the existing resource
    assign_acl_to_existing_resource(filepath, acl_rule)
    
    # Check and verify the ACLs for the resource
    check_acl(filepath)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assigning ACLs to an Existing Resource:**
   - The `chmod +a` command is used to assign or modify the ACLs for an existing file or directory. In this case, the rule allows the `admin` group to read, write, and execute.
   - The function `assign_acl_to_existing_resource()` applies the new ACL rule to the specified file or directory.
   
2. **Checking ACLs on the Resource:**
   - The `ls -le` command lists the ACLs associated with the file or directory. The function `check_acl()` displays the current ACLs, verifying that the changes have been applied successfully.

### Example ACL Rule:
```bash
chmod +a "group:admin allow read,write,execute" /path/to/your/existing_resource
```

This command allows the `admin` group to have read, write, and execute permissions on the resource.

### Modifying Permissions and Ownership for an Existing Resource:
In addition to modifying ACLs, you can change the standard **POSIX permissions** and ownership of an existing file or directory using the following methods:

#### Changing Ownership:
You can change the ownership of an existing resource using the `os.chown()` function in Python:

```python
import os
import pwd
import grp

def change_owner(filepath, owner_name, group_name):
    # Get UID and GID for the specified owner and group
    owner_uid = pwd.getpwnam(owner_name).pw_uid
    group_gid = grp.getgrnam(group_name).gr_gid
    
    # Change the owner and group of the file or directory
    os.chown(filepath, owner_uid, group_gid)
    print(f"Owner changed to '{owner_name}' and group changed to '{group_name}' for '{filepath}'")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    filepath = '/path/to/your/existing_resource'
    
    # Change the owner and group of the resource
    change_owner(filepath, 'nobody', 'nogroup')
```

#### Changing POSIX Permissions:
You can change the standard POSIX permissions using the `os.chmod()` function:

```python
def change_permissions(filepath, permissions):
    # Change the permissions of the file or directory
    os.chmod(filepath, permissions)
    print(f"Permissions for '{filepath}' changed to {oct(permissions)}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    filepath = '/path/to/your/existing_resource'
    
    # Set permissions to 755 (rwxr-xr-x)
    change_permissions(filepath, 0o755)
```

### Explanation:
- **`os.chown()`**: This function changes the owner and group of the specified file or directory.
- **`os.chmod()`**: This function changes the standard POSIX permissions of the file or directory (e.g., 0o755 for `rwxr-xr-x`).

### Key Points:
- **ACLs on macOS**: Access Control Lists (ACLs) provide fine-grained control over permissions, allowing you to specify which users or groups have what level of access to the resource.
- **POSIX Permissions**: Standard Unix-like permissions (read, write, execute) can be modified using `chmod` or via Python using the `os.chmod()` function.
- **Ownership**: You can change the ownership (user and group) of an existing file or directory using `os.chown()` or the `chown` command in the terminal.

### Verifying ACLs and Permissions:
To verify that the ACLs or POSIX permissions have been applied, you can use the following terminal commands:

```bash
# List ACLs and permissions for a file or directory
ls -le /path/to/your/resource
```

This will show the current permissions, ownership, and ACLs applied to the resource.

### Conclusion:
Assigning or modifying security for an existing resource on macOS can be done through Access Control Lists (ACLs), ownership changes, and POSIX permission modifications. This approach is similar to assigning or modifying security descriptors in Windows but adapted to macOSâ€™s Unix-like security model.

Would you like to explore more advanced scenarios, such as recursive ACL changes for directories or handling inheritance of permissions?
