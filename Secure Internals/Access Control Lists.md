On macOS, there isn't a direct equivalent to Windows' **Get-NtGrantedAccess** or the **NtAccessCheck** system call. However, macOS provides its own mechanisms for checking access permissions using **POSIX permissions**, **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**, and system utilities. You can implement similar behavior in Python by performing access checks, querying file ownership, and analyzing permissions.

Here's how you can replicate the **access check process** in macOS using Python. This will simulate checking the granted access for a given user and security descriptor (in macOS terms, the file's owner, group, and permissions).

### Simulating Access Check in Python on macOS

1. **POSIX Permissions**: We'll check the ownership and permissions of the file, simulating the security descriptor behavior in Windows.
2. **Access Mask Simulation**: We'll simulate checking the access (read, write, or execute) based on the file's permissions and ownership.

### Example 1: Check File Permissions and Ownership in Python

This script checks the permissions and ownership of a file, simulating the access check process.

```python
import os
import pwd
import grp

def check_permissions(filepath, desired_access):
    """
    Checks whether the current user has the desired access (read, write, execute) on a file.
    :param filepath: Path to the file.
    :param desired_access: Access type ('read', 'write', or 'execute').
    :return: True if access is granted, False otherwise.
    """
    # Get the file's status information
    file_stat = os.stat(filepath)
    
    # Get the current user's UID and GID
    current_user_uid = os.getuid()
    current_user_gid = os.getgid()
    
    # Get file's owner and group information
    file_owner_uid = file_stat.st_uid
    file_group_gid = file_stat.st_gid
    
    # Get file permissions
    file_permissions = file_stat.st_mode
    
    # Check if the current user is the owner
    if current_user_uid == file_owner_uid:
        # Owner's permissions
        if desired_access == 'read':
            return bool(file_permissions & 0o400)  # Owner read permission
        elif desired_access == 'write':
            return bool(file_permissions & 0o200)  # Owner write permission
        elif desired_access == 'execute':
            return bool(file_permissions & 0o100)  # Owner execute permission
    # Check if the current user belongs to the group that owns the file
    elif current_user_gid == file_group_gid:
        # Group's permissions
        if desired_access == 'read':
            return bool(file_permissions & 0o040)  # Group read permission
        elif desired_access == 'write':
            return bool(file_permissions & 0o020)  # Group write permission
        elif desired_access == 'execute':
            return bool(file_permissions & 0o010)  # Group execute permission
    else:
        # Other's permissions (if the user is neither the owner nor in the group)
        if desired_access == 'read':
            return bool(file_permissions & 0o004)  # Others read permission
        elif desired_access == 'write':
            return bool(file_permissions & 0o002)  # Others write permission
        elif desired_access == 'execute':
            return bool(file_permissions & 0o001)  # Others execute permission
    
    return False  # Access denied by default

def check_access(filepath):
    """
    Simulates the access check process by checking all access types.
    :param filepath: Path to the file.
    """
    for access_type in ['read', 'write', 'execute']:
        if check_permissions(filepath, access_type):
            print(f"Access to {access_type} the file '{filepath}' is granted.")
        else:
            print(f"Access to {access_type} the file '{filepath}' is denied.")


if __name__ == '__main__':
    filepath = '/path/to/your/file_or_directory'
    check_access(filepath)
```

### Explanation:
1. **File Ownership and Permissions**: The script checks the file's owner, group, and permissions using `os.stat()`. This simulates the **security descriptor** in Windows.
2. **Access Checks**: It checks whether the current user (retrieved using `os.getuid()` and `os.getgid()`) has read, write, or execute permissions on the file. This simulates checking the **granted access** in Windows.
3. **POSIX Permissions**: It uses bitwise checks (`0o400`, `0o200`, etc.) to check permissions for the file's owner, group, and others.

### Example 2: Simulating Access for Another User Using `sudo`

You can also check access for another user by running the command as that user using `sudo`:

```bash
sudo -u another_user python3 check_access.py /path/to/your/file_or_directory
```

This simulates impersonation of another user, similar to how you would use **impersonation tokens** in Windows for access checks.

### Example 3: Checking Access Control Lists (ACLs)

macOS supports ACLs, which provide fine-grained permissions beyond basic POSIX permissions. While Python doesn't have built-in support for manipulating ACLs, you can use the **`ls`** and **`chmod`** commands to interact with them through Python's `subprocess` module.

#### Viewing ACLs:

```bash
ls -le /path/to/your/file
```

#### Adding an ACL Entry:

```bash
chmod +a "user:john allow read,write" /path/to/your/file
```

You can integrate this into Python using the `subprocess` module to handle ACLs.

### Example: Using `subprocess` to Check ACLs in Python

```python
import subprocess

def check_acl(filepath):
    result = subprocess.run(['ls', '-le', filepath], capture_output=True, text=True)
    print(result.stdout)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    filepath = '/path/to/your/file'
    check_acl(filepath)
```

### Conclusion:

While macOS does not provide a direct equivalent to Windows' **Get-NtGrantedAccess** or **NtAccessCheck**, you can achieve similar functionality using Python by:
- **Checking POSIX permissions** for file ownership and access rights using `os.stat()` and `os.access()`.
- **Simulating access checks** based on the current user's UID, GID, and the file's permissions.
- **Handling ACLs** using system commands like `ls -le` and `chmod +a`, or by running commands as another user using `sudo`.

These tools allow you to simulate access control behavior in macOS similar to the process described for Windows in the **Get-NtGrantedAccess** command.
